This plugin allows you to effortlessly pull text and images from an Airtable database and inject them straight into your Figma components. Using the plugin is child’s play. First, you build your component in Figma, business as usual. Then, you load up the Airtable 2 Figma plugin, and map the Airtable data fields to the right layers in Figma. Finally, choose the layout you want your component to be laid out as and voilà, you just saved yourself a couple hundred clicks! You now have a nice set of data directly inserted  into your designs. Find out more at: https://figma.bothrs.com\n\nTake a gander at the data types we can import directly from Airtable into Figma:\n\n1. Single line text\n2. Long text\n3. Phone number\n4. Email\n5. Numeric\n6. Image\n\nHere’s a sample database (about cats) for you to experiment with: https://airtable.com/shr0hyEnBae0AKKfQ\n\nNext, follow these steps, or watch a tutorial video over at https://figma.bothrs.com\n\n1. Go to https://airtable.com  and build or select your own table\n2. In your Airtable of choice, click ‘Share’\n3. Scroll down and click ‘Create a shared view’\n4. Click ‘Share the current view’\n5. Next, click ‘Create a shareable grid view’.\n6. Then, copy the link and paste it in the plugin window.\n7. Assign Airtable columns to text nodes or images.\n8.

'available' : 'occupied' -> available\n- 1 -> ['Clear', 'Rain', 'Snow'][$value] -> Rain\n- 1988 -> \"'\" + ($value).toString().substring(2,4) -> '88\n- klm -> `https://airlines/${$value}.png` -> https://airlines/klm.png\n\nAPI Request Options\nIn the case you need to add request options to your API call, you can do so in a separate field and provide the options as an object. To find out which options are available and how they are named, check out the following library: https://github.com/Jam3/xhr-request\nExample usage:\n{\n  \"headers\":{\n     \"secret-key\":\"XXX\"\n  }\n}\n\nNotes\n- Supports only JSON\n- You need to manually select which arrays to loop through after selecting the path\n- Data connected to Component layers do not get transferred to its instances. In this case, connect the data to the instance instead, when you copy an instance the data stays connected.\n- To multiply layers quickly, install the Multiply plugin\n- If you the amount of layers on your page exceeds the limit, the info on the sync page will not auto-refresh when something changes on the page, instead you can use the manual refresh button. This is done to improve performance.\n\nLet me know on Twitter if you have questions, requests or feedback!","lastUpdateDate":"2020-06-07T22:41:22.355Z","tags":["api","array","connect","data","insert","json","object","populate","sync"],"publisherHandle":"eminsinani","publisherId":"649","publisherName":"Emin Sinani","installCount":1331,"likeCount":51,"viewCount":23153},{"id":"760927481606931799","name":"Appearance","description":"This plugin generates a dark/light theme from your selection.\nThe plugin works with external library styles and local styles.\nYou can choose styles name identification in settings.

Install Bannerify and create a new Figma project.\n2. Create as many different sized frames as you need for your banners.\n3. Add any images, text and components to your frames.\n4. Run Bannerify inside the page containing your banner frames.\n5. Apply some animations and timings to the layers inside each frame.\n6. Click the \"Export Banners to HTML\" button to open the export panel.\n7. Choose your export format/options and click \"Export Banners\".\n8. Download and enjoy your HTML banners!\n\nFor a step-by-step video tutorial, visit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TA088FNulA\n\n— Additional Notes\n\n• To start playing with Bannerify right away, you can duplicate this pre-designed example Figma file – https://figma.fun/8Eg9Rf – to easily see how Bannerify works and what the layer structure can look like. This Figma file already has some example animations set on the layers of each banner, too.\n\n• To quickly get started designing your own banners, Bannerify will offer to create some standard banner sizes automatically for you if you run Bannerify inside of an empty Figma page.\n\n• If you add or update any layers in your Figma file while Bannerify is already running, you can click the \"Refresh\" icon in the Bannerify header menu to refresh your layers and make them show up in the Bannerify timeline and real-time previews.\n\n• By default, Bannerify will export all image layers @1x. You can change this for any layer by clicking \"Export +\" in the right-hand column of Figma's UI and adding your own export size setting (@2x, @3x etc).\n\n• Bannerify will automatically detect if a layer contains areas of full transparency and set \"PNG\" as the default export format, otherwise it will be set to \"JPG\". You can override this to set the export format of any layer to JPG, PNG or SVG (for vectors) by adding your own export setting.\n\n• Text layers will automatically be exported as SVG paths to make them sharper than PNG images, have lower file sizes, and avoid loading custom web fonts for each banner.\n\n• You can set a solid background colour of any banner by setting the solid \"fill\" of that frame to the colour you need in Figma (to use gradient backgrounds, please fill a full rectangle layer at the bottom of your frame's layers).\n\n• The name of your Figma document will be used as the \"title\" tag for the exported HTML Bannerify preview page.\n\n— License\n\nAfter you've tried exporting banners with Bannerify 10 times, you'll be asked to enter your license key. Your license key will allow you or your team to animate and export an unlimited amount of HTML banners using Bannerify.\n\nTo purchase a license or to find out more, please visit https://figmaticapp.com/bannerify","lastUpdateDate":"2020-07-05T23:14:16.778Z","tags":["ad","animation","banners","code","css","doubleclick","export","google","gsap","javascript","motion","premium"],"publisherHandle":"figmatic","publisherId":"247","publisherName":"Figmatic","installCount":2779,"likeCount":60,"viewCount":62122},{"id":"857372981274488789","name":"Banners","description":"Add top and bottom banner markings to every page!","lastUpdateDate":"2020-06-23T21:40:05.671Z","tags":["banner","markings"],"publisherHandle":"josericaurte","publisherId":"1114109","publisherName":"Jose Ricaurte","installCount":34,"likeCount":0,"viewCount":4716},{"id":"836508016102947880","name":"Batch Create Component","description":"Select many things, create many components.\n\nThis simple plugin turns selected layers into individual components rather than one big component.","lastUpdateDate":"2020-06-29T23:55:32.522Z","tags":["batch","components","create","instance","library","master","multiple","symbols","system","utility"],"publisherHandle":"ptrckmrgn","publisherId":"68","publisherName":"Patrick Morgan","installCount":93,"likeCount":4,"viewCount":3207},{"id":"818203235789864127","name":"Batch Styler","description":"Change multiple text styles at once!\n\nNeed to change font styles of multiple text styles at once but don't want to go through the process of changing each text style on its own?\n\nWith Batch Styler you can do just that!

Consider slowly growing bubbles by multiplying their width and height by 1.1–1.5x.

Select a layer and Contrast will immediately look for the color directly behind your selection and serve up the contrast ratio along with passing and failing levels from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). If Contrast cannot find the background color, add another layer to your selection, and Contrast will compare them both.\n\nAre you looking to give everything a once-over before finishing?

It does this by taking a sampling of colors from the area directly behind the element and calculating the contrast ratio for each color. Contrast considers a color passing if all colors in the sample pass.\n\nBugs\n\nIf you have a situation where Contrast is not finding the right background, please let us know! Send us an example test case in Figma along with a short description of what you were expecting, and we’ll have a look.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n* Element strokes are not yet supported\n\nSmart Sampling Technique\n\nContrast uses RGBQuant to analyze the selection of pixels behind an element. It looks for colors (pixels) that are represented two or more times within each sub-region (64x64) of the area tested. This method gives the best balance of speed and results. The time it takes Contrast to sample and analyze the colors is proportional to the size of the layer you are testing. I.e., Larger layers, in terms of area, will take longer than smaller areas. Sampling can temporarily block the interface in the same way that exporting a frame might—this shouldn’t be very noticeable for smaller layers.\n\nCredits\n\nContrast was made by the Maark design team.","lastUpdateDate":"2020-05-01T21:16:41.627Z","tags":["a11y","aa","aaa","accessibility","accessible","color","inclusive","ratio","wcag"],"publisherHandle":"alex","publisherId":"1032443","publisherName":"Alex Carr","installCount":23541,"likeCount":279,"viewCount":653781},{"id":"765566315559531236","name":"Convert To RTL (Heb)","description":"This plugin converts text that contains Hebrew letters inside a given text area to RTL.\nIt supports special characters, numbers and Latin letters inside the string.\n\nThis plugins does not support multi lined wrapped text.\nIt flippes only new lines created by \"Enter\" or \"Shift+Enter\".\n\nInstructions:\n1.

Crowdin is a cloud-based localization solution that speeds up and automates translation. Crowdin helps tech companies localize their apps, websites, games, marketing content, and more. As a company-wide solution, it is the place where all teams involved can collaborate and manage the multilingual content together.\n\nWith Crowdin plugin you can\n- Quickly generate multi-language creative assets.\n- Customize the translated copies and fix inconsistencies before the programming starts.\n- Add to your mockups source texts already uploaded to the Crowdin project by other teams.\n- Upload tagged screenshots to your Crowdin project for translators’ reference.\n\nCrowdin and Figma integration works both ways, and the plugin has 2 modes – Page Translation and Crowdin Strings.\n\nPage Translation Mode – Test Designs Before Development\n\nThis mode helps to send texts to Crowdin with the context for translators in a click and upload translations back to Figma. Use this mode to quickly generate multi-language creative assets, like brochures, stickers, and more. As well as preview and customize translated designs before mockups go to development.\n\nIn Crowdin, you can apply different approaches to get the content translated:\n- Pre-translate texts via Machine Translation engines.\n- Invite in-house translators.\n- Hire a professional translation agency.\n- Engage your community in the translation process.\n\nWorking on the texts on Crowdin, translators get design previews as they are on Figma, along with other localization resources like Translation Memories, Glossaries, and more. \n\nCrowdin Strings Mode – Get Source Texts and Upload Screenshots\n\nCrowdin Strings mode allows you to get source texts that are already uploaded to the Crowdin project by other teams and add them to your designs in a click. Great for teams that start localization right from the start and helps to use real texts instead of ‘Lorem Ipsum’ in the designs you create.\n\nWorking in this mode, you can also automatically upload tagged screenshots of the frames where you used the source texts. Screenshots are visible for translators in the Crowdin Editor (a place where all translations happen) and will give more context.\n\nHow to Set Up\n\nTo get started, you will need a Crowdin account and a localization project under it. You can create a new project, or ask for manager access to the existing one. Sign up at https://accounts.crowdin.com/register \n\nIf you manage a project in Crowdin yourself after a 14-day free trial, select one of the subscription plans at https://crowdin.com/pricing#annual.\n\nTo connect Figma and Crowdin accounts:\n\n1. Install Crowdin for Figma Plugin.\n2. Open the necessary Figma file.\n3. Head to the menu in the top-left corner and select Plugins > Crowdin.\n4. Provide Personal Access Token. You can generate it in your Account Settings in Crowdin. \n5. If you’re connecting your Crowdin Enterprise account, specify your organization name.\n\nGet detailed guides on how to use Crowdin for Figma plugin at https://support.crowdin.com/figma-plugin/\n\nContact us 24/7 if you need further assistance https://crowdin.com/contacts","lastUpdateDate":"2020-06-03T11:48:45.151Z","tags":["content","i18n","internationalization","l10n","language","languages","localization","translate","translation","translations","translator","ux"],"publisherHandle":"Crowdin","publisherId":"3192096","publisherName":"Crowdin","installCount":702,"likeCount":31,"viewCount":21679},{"id":"819688895973707151","name":"Crypto Password Protection","description":"Securely share static Figma designs with stakeholders as password protected links\n\n— Features\n\n• Use instantly inside Figma; no extra account creation required.\n• Generates password protected URLs to share with your stakeholders.\n• Automatically generates strong, random/mixed character passwords.\n• Image uploads encrypted with AES-256 and stored in Google Cloud.\n• Fast, beautiful and easy to use preview pages in the browser.\n• Supports multiple versions of your designs on the same preview URL.\n• Authenticated sessions automatically end after the tab is closed.\n• Easily drag frames around to re-order how they're displayed.\n• Remembers your frame selections and order between plugin uses.\n• Relaunch directly from the Figma sidebar in your projects.\n• Automatically deletes URL/uploads if not accessed for 30 days.\n\n— To use Crypto\n\n1.

Note how all the layers within a component or instance will be populated with data from the same record.\n\n---------------\n\nAdding a data source\n\n  •  Try http://myjson.com/ for simple JSON hosting.\n  •  If you want to populate layers randomly, use arrays in your first level of JSON values, e.g. { “users\": [ object1, object2, …, objectN ], “jobs”: [ objectA, objectB, …, objectC ] }.\n  •  Data from these objects is referenced using curly brackets {…} and dot notation, allowing you to populate structured data like {users.name.first} and {jobs.description}.\n  •  If you only have a single array, you don’t need to reference the first key. E.g. for { “data\": [ object1, object2, …, objectN ] }, write {name.first} instead of {data.name.first}\n\nPopulating text\n\n  •  Populate an entire text layer by renaming the layer. \n  •  Alternatively populate a part of a text layer by adding your curly brackets within the text (e.g. “I love {location.city}” becomes “I love New York”). \n  •  The plugin remembers the parts it populated, so you can populate the same layers again and again.\n\nPopulating images\n\n  •  Populate images by renaming a shape layer. \n  •  The data source for images must be a URL to a hosted image.\n  •  Try https://source.unsplash.com/ for easy hosted images.\n\nPopulating a component/instance\n\n  •  When you select a bunch of regular layers, the plugin randomly chooses the records to populate them with. If you want them to all be populated from the same record, turn them into a component (or instance).\n  •  Add data to your library components so that they’re ready to go!\n\nRoadmap...?\n\n  •  Manage multiple data sources\n  •  Use data from google sheets and other sources\n  •  Basic functions like random() and if()\n  •  DM me suggestions!","lastUpdateDate":"2020-02-23T23:19:06.724Z","tags":["api","content","data","image","information","json","live","lorem","populate","replace","spreadsheet","sync"],"publisherHandle":"ptrckmrgn","publisherId":"68","publisherName":"Patrick Morgan","installCount":628,"likeCount":33,"viewCount":12965},{"id":"802301551610616662","name":"Data Roulette","description":"Insert randomized data from Google Sheets into tagged layers in your designs.

Run the Data Roulette plugin. Create a new data set and paste yuor public sheet url in\n3. Tag layers in Figma with column titles prefixed with '#'\n4. Select layers and click \"Insert Data\" to get random data inserted based on the tags in your selection\n\nTags\n- Tag layers with using '#' followed by the column title. Example: #Description for a column titled 'Description' in Google Sheets\n- Tags can contain spaces. Example: #User Name\n\nData Sets\n- Create multiple Data Sets to separate and organize data from multiple spreadsheets\n\nCombine Tags\n- Combine tags using '+'. Example: #First Name + #Last Name\n- You can insert a text value and color the text using this method. Example: #Comment + #Comment Color\n\nImages\n- Add urls to images (must be https) in your sheet. Tagging shape layers with image url data will apply the linked images as fills.\n- Supports base64 data urls (e.g. data:image/png;base64...)\n\nColors\n- Add colors as Hex, RGB, or RGBA values in your sheet. Tagging a shape or text layer will apply colors as a fills.\n\nGrouping\nData is grouped by row, so for instance if you have 'Firstname' and 'Lastname' columns, filling data into tagged layers will pair the appropriate values for that user entry. If you want to separate data use another data set, or create multiple sheets within a single Google Sheet for each tyoe of related data.","lastUpdateDate":"2020-04-13T10:41:02.672Z","tags":["data","google","random","sheets"],"publisherHandle":"Hamish","publisherId":"555","publisherName":"Hamish","installCount":208,"likeCount":11,"viewCount":19063},{"id":"736737028247625415","name":"Datavizer","description":"Create a bar chart, scatter plot, or line chart easily with your own data!

This usually is a \"header\" and \"body copy\" (see artwork picture above). \n\nThe frame must have the following settings:\n- Either contrained \"top and bottom\" or \"scale\" (vertical) \n\nThe top element must have the following settings:\n- Constrained to the top\n- Grow vertically (for text)\n- Align top (for text)\n\nThe bottom element must have the following settings:\n-  Contrained to the bottom\n- Grow vertically (for text)\n- Align bottom (for text)\n\nIf you've done this setup, open up the plugin modal, select the element or elements you want to resize and click \"run\". \n\nThe plugin will run it's magic. It will maintain the space between the two elements within the frame (in the example in the artwork, 20px). If you want to change the spacing, adjust the master, then select the elements and return the plugin. \n\nI will create an automatic resizer when figma allows for long lasting plugins. \n\nAny other feedback, feel free to email me at daniel_maddock@intuit.com","lastUpdateDate":"2019-08-13T17:04:30.561Z","tags":["components","instances","lineheight","resize","spacing","utility"],"publisherHandle":"1458460","publisherId":"1458460","publisherName":"Daniel Maddock","installCount":2993,"likeCount":9,"viewCount":15976},{"id":"781591244449826498","name":"Easing Gradient","description":"Linear gradients often have hard edges where they start and/or end.\nThis plugin adds gradient stops to approximate easing functions.\n\nRoadmap:\n- Easing function selection\n- Custom bezier curve editor\n- Custom color step input\n- Color space selection","lastUpdateDate":"2019-11-29T04:42:55.627Z","tags":["easing","gradients","smooth","vector"],"publisherHandle":"matchai","publisherId":"27706","publisherName":"Matan Kushner","installCount":3116,"likeCount":55,"viewCount":32079},{"id":"750743440401413268","name":"Easometric","description":"With Easometric it is really easy to create isometric layers & groups.\n\nThis plugin using SSR30⁰, which is the most popular and flexible method of creating isometric artworks.

The plugin calculates the sizes and position of your selected items automatically!\n\nYou can:\n\n- Align your selection between the two parts of the Golden Ratio (Major & Minor)\n- Resize and align your selection to match the Major Golden Ratio part\n- Round all size / position changes by multiplier of 8\n\n—\n\nHow to use it:\n\n1. Select a layer (it can be anything like Rectangles, Images, Text, Groups, Components, ...). Even multiple layers are supported\n2. Right Click > Plugins > \"Golden Ratio Align & Resize\"\n3. Select one of the four methods\n\n—\n\nFAQ\n\n1. What does the option \"Round by 8px\" does?\n\nIt rounds the automatically generated new position / size of your selection to the nearest multiplier of 8. This can be useful, if you work in the 8px Grid. E.g.: 90px -> 92px, 87px -> 88px, etc...\n\n2. What does the option \"Rotate direction\" does?\n\nIt rotates the direction to either vertical or horizontal. The default setting is based on the width of your selection's parent frame. If its wider than tall, the direction of the Golden Ratio calculation is horizontal. \n\n—\n\nFeature requests? 😊 Questions?\nJust hit me on Twitter (@madebyfabian), via mail (hello@madebyfabian.com) or via an Issue on GitHub.\n\n—\n\nMade with ❤️ by Fabian B. in Nuremberg, Germany.

Whereas Force Hide will hide the layer in all the instances of all the components that this icon is used.\n\nThis plugin works only on instances and not on components\nCAUTION: When using the Force Hide option. ensure that the name of the layer you are hiding is unique.

Our design team has been slowly pulling our color libraries into Figma, and early on in the process, we realized this was a long and tedious task. Because the color themes for the products we work on can be quite extensive, manually creating color styles and a visual color guide takes a lot of time. We decided that Microsoft's Hackathon 2019 would be an excellent opportunity to team up and try and fix this problem. Over the course of three days, we built Kaleidocode to address the gap in our workflow and improve the design process not only for our team but anyone else designing for VS Code.\n\nKaleidocode's creators are Kaitlin Wilkinson, Miguel Solorio, and Pine Wu.","lastUpdateDate":"2019-08-02T23:58:07.001Z","tags":["color","styles","swatches","themes","vscode"],"publisherHandle":"microsoft","publisherId":"1500","publisherName":"Microsoft","installCount":2990,"likeCount":25,"viewCount":28879},{"id":"829240879167560536","name":"Khoj","description":"Want to find and navigate to the artboards of your choice and see your recent searches?

Overriding colors, text, and other properties on component instances, and \nb. Swapping out instances of components, such as a icons or states.\n\nBut when you swap an instance, you lose all the overrides you've made, including changes to nested instances within a parent component.\n\nMaximum Override allows you to copy your overrides, swap out an instance, and then paste the overrides back onto the new instance, to retain all of your changes. This includes nested instances that you've swapped with a different symbol.\n\n2. Compare properties between objects\n\nMaximum Override also allows you to select any two nodes on the stage and compare them against each other to see what's different. (In software, this is known as a \"diff\".) You can then copy the changes from object A to object B, or vice-versa. If you select a single instance, Maximum Override will compare it against its own master component.\n\n------------\n\nBugs? Suggestions? Contributions?

Just select anything you would like to \"neumorph\", open the plugin and boom. It adds shadows and gradient fills to your selection, which you can customize to your needs.\n\nWhat is neumorphism?\n\nIt's a UI trend which is using multiple shadows and gradients to \"fake\" light and to bring back a more natural and realistic look and feel. Kind of like skeuomorphism in iOS back in 2007. Read more about it here: https://uxdesign.cc/neumorphism-in-user-interfaces-b47cef3bf3a6\n\n—\n\nA few tips how to create beautiful neumorphic designs:\n\n- The background layer and the layer you are \"neumorphing\" should have the same color.\n\n- If you neumorph' text, be sure to also have it the same color, open the plugin, and when you're done, you can change the text color to a darker one, for better readability. \n\n- Neumorphism doesn't work on pure white or pure black, because it adds shadows that are darker / brighter than the background/current selection fill. If you use pure white or black, it will miss one of the shadows and it won't feel \"neumorphistic\" anymore. I'll suggest to take a kind of bluish tint of white / black.\n\n—\n\nThank you very much for the kind help for the color calculation-algorithm from Adam, he built the site https://neumorphism.io/ on which you can generate neumorphic CSS shadows.

A few options will also be available to you to optimize how Paddet updates your paddings. The last used settings are saved for each frame so you can easily let paddy automagically update your paddings on the fly without having to check your settings again.\n\nFAQ\n* Can I use it on component instances?\nYes you can! Do keep in mind it will firstly apply the padding to your master component and update the selected instances afterwards. Another important note to mention is that whenever your master component updates all your instances will be affected as well, however paddy will not automatically update your instances for their respective content. If this is something you want you need to use the :paddet-autoupdate flag on the instance name\n\n* What does the :paddet-autoupdate flag do in the name of an instance?\nIf a component instance has this flag in it's name Paddet wil update the instance for it's content whenever Paddet is used on the master component.\n\n* What does using :paddet-ignore in my layer name do?\nThis flag will ensure Paddet does not take into account that layer when it is calculating the width and height of the current content. This is especially useful when you have a seperate layer for your background as you do not want this layer to be taken into account as actual content.\n\n* What does using :paddet-resize in my layer name do?\nUsing the resize flag will tell Paddet to resize it along with your frame.  As with the ignore flag, this is useful when you have a background layer.\n\n* Can I combine the ignore and resize flags?\nYes you can.\n\n* Will Paddet remember my settings?\nYes, whenever you update a frame with Paddet it will save your last used settings for that specific frame. This way you can use the \"Auto update padding\" option to easily re-update your paddings without having to open the complete plugin.","lastUpdateDate":"2019-08-24T10:08:58.118Z","tags":["buttons","layout","mobile","padding","responsive"],"publisherHandle":"liam","publisherId":"74154","publisherName":"Liam Martens","installCount":8800,"likeCount":21,"viewCount":37853},{"id":"746314565953874339","name":"Paddi","description":"❖ OVERVIEW\nPaddi helps you to set paddings for a Group, a Frame, or a Component. When you specify the padding values in the component name you can change the elements inside the component and apply the paddings in one click. The component will automatically resize itself so that it surrounds all other elements within the component according to padding values.\n\nSpecify the padding values within the component group or frame name. E.g. button [12 24]. The format of the padding values is in the same order as CSS.\n\n❖ FEATURES\n✅ Paddi works with Groups, Frames, Components, Libraries.\n✅ Paddi is simple! The only thing you need to do is specify the paddings in the component name\n✅ Recognize components with paddings looking at their names. ⚡️ It works the same as in CSS.\n✅ Paddi is flexible. No limitation there, set the same padding for all sides [12] or different for each one [12 24 14 32].\n✅ Paddi uses a base element as a parent and calculates paddings from it.\n✅ Speed up your workflow! You don’t need to open plugin settings all the time you need to update paddings. You only need to rename the component and run the Paddi.\n✅ Natural master & instance behavior. If you change master component paddings, you don’t need to do anything else to update instances, Paddi will update all instances automatically.\n✅ Paddi works with libraries. Create a master component in your library file and apply the padding for all its instances in any project file. ⚠️ If you change padding for the master component in the library you will have to update all instances in the other files manually.\n\n❖ PADDINGS\nPadding values sets by clockwise from top to left sides. It works the same as in CSS. Examples:\n- [12] - padding for all sides - 12px\n- [12 24] - top&bottom - 12px, right&left - 24 px\n- [12 24 32] - top - 12px, right&left - 24px, bottom - 32px\n- [12 24 32 16] - top - 12px, right - 24px, bottom - 32px, left - 16px\n\n❖ FORMATS\nWe recommend to use space for separating padding values to keep it simple, however, you can use a comma as well. Examples:\n- [12 24]\n- [12, 24, 24, 12]\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A GROUP\n1. Create a rectangle. This element will be the base of the component\n2. Put some text or another shape inside the rectangle\n3. Group these elements\n4. Select the Group and whether rename the Group by adding e.g. [16 32] at the end of the name or just run Paddi to apply the default values - [12 24]\n5. Change text or resize elements inside the Group\n6. Select the Group and run Paddi again to apply the paddings\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A FRAME\n1. Write some text or create a shape\n2. Wrap it with a Frame\n3. ⚠️ In case you have only one element in the Frame the paddings will calculate from the Frame to its element. ⚠️ In case you have more than 1 element inside the Frame and want to use this Frame as the base you need to wrap all its elements with a Group\n4. Select the Frame and whether rename the Frame by adding e.g. [16 32] at the end of the name or just run Paddi to apply the default values - [12 24]\n5. Change text or resize elements inside the Frame\n6. Select the Frame and run Paddi again to apply the paddings\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A COMPONENT\n1. After you have a Group with some paddings create a master component from it\n2. Set constraints for the master component to make sure its instances will responsive correctly. Set Scale for the base and make sure all other elements have Left and Top\n3. Change elements and run Paddi. ⚠️ Because you can’t change elements position in an instance you will be able to change only the text elements and then apply the paddings\n\n❖ IGNORE\nTo ignore some elements in your component, rename the necessary ones with [ignore] or [nopaddi] at the end of its name.\n\n❖ IMPORTANT TO KNOW\n⚠️ The lowest element in a group or frame is going to be the base of the component! So don't forget to add a base.\n⚠️ The base element in your component will be marked as (base) in the layer name.\n⚠️ You can’t change paddings for instance because you can’t change its elements positioning. To handle it, go to the master component or detach the instance.\n⚠️ If you want to set a Frame as a base and specify paddings for it, wrap all elements inside this frame in a group to have only one element in the frame and then apply Paddi.\n\n❖ WHERE TO USE\n✅ Buttons\n✅ Tab items\n✅ Navigation items\n✅ Dropdown menus\n✅ Tags / Pils / Badges\n✅ Tooltips / Popovers\n✅ Icons\n✅ UI Cards\n✅ Modal dialogs\n✅ Sections\n✅ Etc.\n\n❖ SHORTCUT FOR MAC OS\nTo speed up your workflow add a shortcut to Paddi. It takes a minute to set up but keeps a lot of time later on.\nOpen System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts tab -> App Shortcuts -> Add new:\n1. Application: Figma\n2. Menu Title: Paddi\n3. Keyboard shortcut: cmd+shift+P (You can use your own)\n\n---\n\n😎 MADE BY\nOleksandr Telnov & Mikhail Voloshin at Dumka.io","lastUpdateDate":"2019-10-25T10:50:34.888Z","tags":["autolayout","design","layout","padding","ui"],"publisherHandle":"dumkaio","publisherId":"1312969","publisherName":"Oleksandr Telnov","installCount":2776,"likeCount":19,"viewCount":17181},{"id":"841201477778898873","name":"Page Automator","description":"\"Tired to manually add new page one by one when starting new project in Figma?\"\n\nPage Automator will help you solve this by automate creating multiple pages in just one click.\n\n• Make your own page automator.\nMake your own page automator with providing list of pages.

Please ensure your page only includes frames you want to include in your presentation to avoid excessive load times.\n\n• You can set a solid background colour on any slide by setting the \"fill\" of that frame to the colour you'd like in Figma. If you'd like to use a gradient background, please use a rectangle background layer to do this.\n\n• Editable text layers for PowerPoint/Keynote/Google Slides exports is currently in BETA; there may be some inconsistencies with the formatting in your design. You can enable it by toggling \"Use Editable Text\" in the export settings.\n\n• If you add or update any layers in your Figma file while Pitchdeck is already running, you can click the \"Refresh\" icon in the Pitchdeck header menu to refresh your layers and make them show up in the Pitchdeck slides and animation previews.\n\n• Pitchdeck will automatically detect if a layer contains areas of full transparency and set \"PNG\" as the default export format, otherwise it will be set to \"JPG\". You can override this to set the export format of any layer to JPG or PNG by adding your own export setting.\n\n• Safari has compatibility issues with the PDF export option; to use this option, please run Pitchdeck in another browser (like Chrome or Firefox) or the Figma desktop app.\n\n• Presentation URLs will automatically expire after a 30 day period of inactivity (30 days after the link was last accessed and viewed); if you would like to re-activate the URL after it has expired, simply run Pitchdeck in the Figma file and click \"Upload Web Presentation\".\n\n— License\n\nAfter you've tried exporting presentations with Pitchdeck 10 times, you'll be asked to enter your license key.

When you press Cmd+Shift+C texts from currently selected input and all inputs down from it will be copied to clipboard with new lines as a delimiters. \n• Now tabs also works as a delimiters with multiline paste. With that you can copipaste rows from Goolge Sheets and other places.\n\nSee some details and video preview here: https://twitter.com/aswellasyouare/status/1179063309280174081","lastUpdateDate":"2020-04-03T16:06:42.521Z","tags":["bulk","change","copy","exchange","fill","input","paste","replace","text"],"publisherHandle":"vadim","publisherId":"779","publisherName":"Vadim Pleshkov","installCount":1935,"likeCount":42,"viewCount":20905},{"id":"812994090875519300","name":"Retro Snake","description":"Worked for too long?

Primary600? That name doesn't mean much. PrimaryButtonLabel? That's clear as can be.\n\nThis plugin makes it simple to maintain a collection of semantically named colors that derive their color from your base palette. Not only does this allow you to increase clarity of usage, it also lays the foundation necessary for theming within your apps. \n\nFor more details on why you should implement your colors this way, read this blog post:\nhttps://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7\n\nUsing Semantic Color Sync is simple. First, create your base palette. For each base palette color, add a consistent prefix, such as “.palette/”\n\nNext, create a series of semantically named colors. In the description for each semantically named color, add the base palette color it derives from (including the prefix). For example: “.palette/primary600”\n\nNext, when you decide to change your primary hue from blue to bright pink (good choice, btw), the Semantic Color Sync plugin will automatically search through every semantically named color and update their color to match the updates made in your base palette. \n\nNo need to update things by hand... Ugh. Just tweak your base palette and run this plugin to propagate the changes throughout all of your semantically named colors!\n\nAnd again, if you’re curious why this is useful, this blog post has it all laid out: \nhttps://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7","lastUpdateDate":"2020-02-27T18:44:48.679Z","tags":["color","colors","designsystems","semantic","sync"],"publisherHandle":"YNAB","publisherId":"1890","publisherName":"You Need A Budget","installCount":467,"likeCount":30,"viewCount":13595},{"id":"749061307736645564","name":"Send to Components Page","description":"If you prefer to keep your components on a separate page and are tired of carrying them manually, this plugin is for you.\n\n1.

In some cases, we have 15px spacing, and in another place, 14px. It's hard always to update all these spacings manually.\n\nWith the help of auto layout, we can resolve this problem. Just turn on the auto layout feature with zero spacing between the elements and use \"spacers\" between.\n\nThere are different ways, but I prefer to use the 8-Point Grid System. You can use premade \"spacers\" from the public library (https://www.figma.com/c/file/809152234949654615/Spacings) and place them between the elements. In that case, you will make sure that the spacings between the components are consistent.\n\nHow it works\nAdd the library https://www.figma.com/c/file/809152234949654615/Spacings or have own symbols that have \"$spacing\" word in the name;\nUse them when needed\nIf you want to hide them, select a parent frame and run the plugin. It will look for all spacers that were used on the frame and will set zero opacity\nIf you want to show spacers back, just rerun the plugin. If the first spacer on the row will have zero opacity, it will set 100% for all spacers found on the selected frame.\n\nPro tip\nYou can set \"cmd\"+\"option\"+\"H\" hotkey via system preferences in Mac to toggle spacers visibility quickly.

This plugin will do it for you!\n\nThis plugin will let you do this:\n\n1. Manage style references on a selected node\n2. Auto-update all references as you change origins (keep the plugin open for this)\n3. Export references to make it available for third-party consumers\n4. Switch contexts\n\n# 1. Manage References\n\nSelect a node for which you want to manage references, eg. a rectangle. Open the \"Style References\" plugin and a dialog will appear that let you do it. Currently these styles are supported:\n\n- Fill Style\n- Stroke Style\n- Effect Style\n\nFor each of those there is a section in the dialog where you can manage the origin style to the reference.\n\n- **Origin** That's the _original_ style.\n- **Reference** That's the style to which the origin is copied over when references are updated.\n\n## Transforms\n\nFor paint styles (Fill and Stroke) transforms are available. When styles\nare referenced from origin to reference you can put transforms in between.\nAvailabe are HSL + Opacity values. They will be applied during\nreferencing.\n\nUse this to automate your color palette. Make one color swatch for your\nbase value (e.g. \"Brand / 500\"). A darker color would take your base value as\nreference and set lightness to \"-20\" - name it for example \"Brand / 300\".\n\n# 2. Export\n\nYou can export your references to jsonbin.io and by that make it available for third-party consumers, e.g. if you want to update your design tokens in your code. Here is how:\n\nEnter credentials in settngs:\n\n1. Create an account and copy the API Key\n2. Create a bin and copy the bin URL\n\nOn the tools tab the `Export Settings` button becomes available. Clicking the button will export your references.\n\n# 3. Import\n\nYou can import your earlier exported references from jsonbin.io. That is really helpful when you duplicated your document - figma will not copy over your stored references. Here is how to import references:\n\n1. Duplicate a document\n2. Open the old document, open the plugin, go to settings and copy the Bin URL\n3. Go the new new document (the plugin should still be opened), paste the URL into the input for import and click the button next to it.\n4. A notification will appear telling you how much references were imported.\n5. You can work with your new document the same way as the old one now - win!\n\n# 4. Contexts\n\nContexts are a lightweight way to organize various theme modes within one document. E.g. if you have light and dark mode in one document, you may want to give styles for respective styles a specific suffix, e.g. `.$dark` - With defined contexts, you can swap between them quickly and then use Themer to export them.\n\n## Workflow Suggestion\n\nUse it in combination with Themer:\n\n1. Set your variants for each context (`§light` and `§dark`)\n2. Select a context\n3. Use `Style References` to map those \"compiled\" styles\n4. Use `Themer` to export and apply them\n\n### Things to Know\n\n- When setting the origin style the suggestions only show local styles, that is also due to limitations of the current figma API, given security reasons for shared team libraries. That's fair - figma keeps us safe, give them credit for that :)\n\nIt still is possible to use library styles, then you can't use the style references manage dialog, instead manually assign those style and THEN use the style references dialog in order to persist it.\n\n- Once you have one node \"under management\", you may want to change the local style but once you update references, those new ones will be overridden. Re-select the node again and the references dialog will provide you options for migrating styles, to either keep the old one or use the new one.\n\n- Once you link origin to reference the node itself will show the reference as its local style, which might give you wonders, yet is expected and the correct behavior.","lastUpdateDate":"2020-06-07T12:13:14.648Z","tags":["alias","automation","config","contexts","dark","designops","designtokens","light","mapping","references","styles","theme"],"publisherHandle":"gossi","publisherId":"891","publisherName":"Thomas Gossmann","installCount":649,"likeCount":23,"viewCount":22646},{"id":"844318739744428676","name":"Theme Switcher","description":"Are you looking for a plugin that quickly lets you switch multi-branded style sheets, improve your workflow, and reduce your work-time by ¼?

Use it for color, text and effect styles.\n\nHow does it work?\nThemer associates published styles with a theme name. When you have multiple themes, Themer will swap styles that match across themes: which means you need two styles with the same names in each theme.\n\nIn order for Themer to be used across your team, generic information about your styles is shared on a external service (jsonbin.io). You will need an account with an API key to get started (You can easily sign in with Google, GutHub or Twitter).\n\nWatch the setup video on YouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM8SkksBy3Y&feature=youtu.be\n\n1. Insert your API key from JSONbin\n\n2. Create your first theme, giving it a unique name, and then choose where you want to pull the styles from (all local styles, styles used on the page, or a selection).\n\n*Tip*: If all of your styles exist within one document, you can also prefix your style names with 'theme1/' or 'theme2/' and set Themer to generate multiuple themes at once.\n\n3. With your themes created, you can now apply them to a selection or the entire page. Remember, your design must make use of the same styles from one of the themes to work.\n\nPrivacy:\nThemer stores information about your styles at a service external to Figma. For each theme, we store the name of the theme, the name of the style, the type of style (color, text, effect), and a unique key required to import your styles into a document from your team library. No other data from your file is sent to Jsonbin. Your unique API key is storred locally as well, so if you use Themer across devices, between team members, or between Figma Desktop and Figma in the browser, you will need to re-enter your API key and your Bin URL so that everyone/everywhere has access to the same list of Themes.\n\nRemember to publish your styles before creating a Theme :)\n\nRoadmap:\n• Currently Themer does not yet work text boxes which contan multiple text styles, the plan is to enable this in the near future","lastUpdateDate":"2020-05-07T01:19:38.961Z","tags":["style","styles","swap","theme"],"publisherHandle":"tom","publisherId":"35","publisherName":"Tom Lowry","installCount":14136,"likeCount":194,"viewCount":344716},{"id":"772499949564209716","name":"Third","description":"A Figma plugin that lets you import, lit, use and render 3D models right there in Figma 🙈\n\nWatch the video https://youtu.be/XRP-9JM7h4A to see how to use the Third plugin for Figma.\n\n💡 Features\n-   ⚡ A viewport to interact with 3D models.\n-   🔥 High resolution and transparent rendering.\n-   😽 Easy to use UI.\n-   ✨ Supports multiple 3D Object model format for import.\n-   🚀 Lightweight.\n\n🤔 TODOS\nAdd support for postprocessing effects such as\n* Color grading.\n* Bloom.\n* Vignette and Dither.","lastUpdateDate":"2019-12-14T21:54:33.053Z","tags":["design","fun","import","models"],"publisherHandle":"victor_aremu","publisherId":"203619","publisherName":"Victor Aremu","installCount":1808,"likeCount":54,"viewCount":24498},{"id":"776033210163988440","name":"Thrshold","description":"Apply simple Threshold Effect Filter on images.

You can also click/highlight layers in Figma to quickly select only those images compressing if you have lots to browse through in your page.\n\n• Compressing PNG and PDF exports can take a bit longer than JPG and SVG exports, especially if they're very detailed or have large dimensions. TinyImage will warn you if an image is too large to compress.\n\n• Safari has compatibility issues; please run TinyImage in another browser (like Chrome or Firefox) or the Figma desktop app.\n\n— License\n\nAfter you've tried compressing images with TinyImage 15 times, you'll be asked to enter your license key.
