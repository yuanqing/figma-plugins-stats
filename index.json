This plugin allows you to effortlessly pull text and images from an Airtable database and inject them straight into your Figma components. Using the plugin is child’s play. First, you build your component in Figma, business as usual. Then, you load up the Airtable 2 Figma plugin, and map the Airtable data fields to the right layers in Figma. Finally, choose the layout you want your component to be laid out as and voilà, you just saved yourself a couple hundred clicks! You now have a nice set of data directly inserted&nbsp;into your designs.</p><p><br></p><p>Learn more at: https://figma.bothrs.com</p><p><br></p><p>This plugin is not under active maintenance or support, but you can discuss things at https://github.com/thgh/Airtable-to-Figma</p><p><br></p><p>Take a gander at the data types we can import directly from Airtable into Figma:</p><p><br></p><p>1. Single line text</p><p>2. Long text</p><p>3. Phone number</p><p>4. Email</p><p>5. Numeric</p><p>6. Image</p><p><br></p><p>Here’s a sample database (about cats) for you to experiment with: https://airtable.com/shr0hyEnBae0AKKfQ</p><p><br></p><p>Next, follow these steps, or watch a tutorial video over at https://figma.bothrs.com</p><p><br></p><p>1. Go to https://airtable.com and build or select your own table</p><p>2. In your Airtable of choice, click ‘Share’</p><p>3. Scroll down and click ‘Create a shared view’</p><p>4. Click ‘Share the current view’</p><p>5. Next, click ‘Create a shareable grid view’.</p><p>6. Then, copy the link and paste it in the plugin window.</p><p>7. Assign Airtable columns to text nodes or images.</p><p>8. Select the view you want to use and configure the rest</p><p>9. Done!

Simply save color styles as you normally do and Color Theme Manager can help you with the rest. No need to worry about JSON, naming prefix, selection, etc. Good for developing color systems, projects require multiple color themes (like dark mode and light mode), and giving your design a new look.\n\nFeatures\n\nSave Color Theme\nCarefully name your current color theme and it will be saved within the Figma file you are working with. This will save all local color styles into a color theme. Note color styles in color themes will not update when you modified local color styles, you need to manually save changes to color themes.\n\nApply Color Theme\nChange to an entirely different look by applying a color theme with only one click. Your local color styles will be replaced by ones from the color theme you choose.\n\n Import/Export Color Themes\nDue to the current Figma Plugin API limitation, transferring data across Figma file can not be streamlined. A second-best solution is offered by Color Theme Manager, simply copy your saved color theme into clipboard and paste to another file.\n\nHow?\n\nColor Theme Manager will look for color style from a saved theme with the exact same name and replace the local style. So name your color styles (and color themes) wisely.

Create a new component, or choose an existing component, and move it out of any parent frames so its frame is at the top level of the document, not embedded inside any other frames.\n\n2. Name the component anything you'd like, but make sure it ends with \" ? \" followed by the name of the condition it represents. Example: \"Header ? Anonymous\" or \"Navigation / Bottom Tabs ? Anonymous\"\n\n3. Place instances of the component into any places within your design you'd like it to appear.\n\n4. Create a new conditional variation, also at the top level within the page. You can do this by duplicating the original component and changing overrides, or you can make a completely new frame with completely different content. Make the new instance or frame into a component, and name it to match the first conditional variation. Example: \"Header ? Logged-in\" or \"Navigation / Bottom Tabs ? Logged-in\"\n\n5. Repeat step 4 for as many conditional variations you'd like to make for this component.\n\n6. Wrap all the conditional variations together in one frame. Name the frame using the component name, followed by \" ?\" at the end.

Defaults to `main.yml`.</p><p>- <strong>Organization name [Bitbucket only]</strong>: Your organization's name (might also be called \"workspace\").</p><p>- <strong>Definition ID [Azure only]</strong>: The seemingly random (?)

The easiest way to get it is to navigate to your pipeline in the Azure DevOps web console and check the URL bar which should look like: `https://dev.azure.com/YOUR_USER/YOUR_PROJECT/_build?definitionId=16`.</p><p>- <strong>Branch</strong>: Should be same as the branch you want to trigger. Defaults to `main`.</p><p><br></p><p>The optional fields are:</p><p>- <strong>Message</strong>: Can be used to provide the CI workflow some context on what's changed.</p><p>- <strong>Version</strong>: Can be used to provide the CI workflow information on a version.

It does this by taking a sampling of colors from the area directly behind the element and calculating the contrast ratio for each color. Contrast considers a color passing if all colors in the sample pass.</p><p><br></p><h2>Bugs</h2><p>If you have a situation where Contrast is not finding the right background, please let us know! Send us an example test case in Figma along with a short description of what you were expecting, and we’ll have a look.</p><p><br></p><h2>Known Issues</h2><ul><li>Element strokes are not yet supported</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Smart Sampling Technique</h2><p>Contrast uses <a href=\"https://github.com/leeoniya/RgbQuant.js/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">RGBQuant</a> to analyze the selection of pixels behind an element. It looks for colors (pixels) that are represented two or more times within each sub-region (64x64) of the area tested. This method gives the best balance of speed and results. The time it takes Contrast to sample and analyze the colors is proportional to the size of the layer you are testing. I.e., Larger layers, in terms of area, will take longer than smaller areas. Sampling can temporarily block the interface in the same way that exporting a frame might—this shouldn’t be very noticeable for smaller layers.</p><p><br></p><h2>Credits</h2><p>Contrast was made by the Maark design team.</p>","id":"748533339900865323","installCount":163340,"lastUpdateDate":"2022-05-11T20:38:39.611Z","likeCount":1570,"name":"Contrast","publisherHandle":"6bf381fd_7d7d_4","publisherId":"984548590427335154","publisherName":"Maark","viewCount":133382},{"description":"<p>Contrast lets you quickly run a AA or AAA type contrast report on all text across all your artboards at once.

Inspired by Sketch Data Populator, this plugin allows you to connect a JSON data source and quickly populate text and images.\n\nTry it out\n\n  1 - Click “Manage Data Source” and add the demo JSON file: https://api.myjson.com/bins/zdv2i\n  2 - Create a Text layer and rename it \"{name.first}\"\n  3 - Create a Rectangle or Ellipse layer and rename it \"{avatar}\"\n  4 - Create another text layer, rename it “location” and type into it “{location.city}, {location.country}”\n  5 - Select all your new layers and click “Populate”.\n  6 - Turn the layers into a component and populate again. Note how all the layers within a component or instance will be populated with data from the same record.\n\n---------------\n\nAdding a data source\n\n  •  Try http://myjson.com/ for simple JSON hosting.\n  •  If you want to populate layers randomly, use arrays in your first level of JSON values, e.g. { “users\": [ object1, object2, …, objectN ], “jobs”: [ objectA, objectB, …, objectC ] }.\n  •  Data from these objects is referenced using curly brackets {…} and dot notation, allowing you to populate structured data like {users.name.first} and {jobs.description}.\n  •  If you only have a single array, you don’t need to reference the first key. E.g. for { “data\": [ object1, object2, …, objectN ] }, write {name.first} instead of {data.name.first}\n\nPopulating text\n\n  •  Populate an entire text layer by renaming the layer. \n  •  Alternatively populate a part of a text layer by adding your curly brackets within the text (e.g. “I love {location.city}” becomes “I love New York”). \n  •  The plugin remembers the parts it populated, so you can populate the same layers again and again.\n\nPopulating images\n\n  •  Populate images by renaming a shape layer. \n  •  The data source for images must be a URL to a hosted image.\n  •  Try https://source.unsplash.com/ for easy hosted images.\n\nPopulating a component/instance\n\n  •  When you select a bunch of regular layers, the plugin randomly chooses the records to populate them with. If you want them to all be populated from the same record, turn them into a component (or instance).\n  •  Add data to your library components so that they’re ready to go!\n\nRoadmap...?\n\n  •  Manage multiple data sources\n  •  Use data from google sheets and other sources\n  •  Basic functions like random() and if()\n  •  DM me suggestions!","id":"787488293482536319","installCount":2291,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-02-23T23:19:06.724Z","likeCount":92,"name":"Data Populator","publisherHandle":"ptrckmrgn","publisherId":"68","publisherName":"Patrick Morgan","viewCount":5851},{"description":"<p>Insert randomized data from Google Sheets into tagged layers in your designs.

Within the frame you must have 2 elements; these are the ones that you'll fill up with content and will change from instance to instance. This usually is a \"header\" and \"body copy\" (see artwork picture above). \n\nThe frame must have the following settings:\n- Either contrained \"top and bottom\" or \"scale\" (vertical) \n\nThe top element must have the following settings:\n- Constrained to the top\n- Grow vertically (for text)\n- Align top (for text)\n\nThe bottom element must have the following settings:\n-  Contrained to the bottom\n- Grow vertically (for text)\n- Align bottom (for text)\n\nIf you've done this setup, open up the plugin modal, select the element or elements you want to resize and click \"run\". \n\nThe plugin will run it's magic. It will maintain the space between the two elements within the frame (in the example in the artwork, 20px).

Read more about the plugin below.</p><p><br></p><h2>Component Variants</h2><p><br></p><p>With component exports (React and Vue), asset families can be combined into a single component with auto-created variants to pass as props. (e.g. up, right, down, and left arrow icons can be converted to a single Arrow component). There is no limit to the amount of variant types and setup is easy: all that’s required is a specific layer-naming scheme. <em>Note that variants are based on a specific layer-naming scheme, not Figma’s official variant feature.</em></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://oombla.com/documentation/component-variants\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">More</a></p><p><br></p><h2>Customizable Templates</h2><p><br></p><p>The exported code works entirely as-is without any modifications required. But if desired, you have the ability to customize the code output to your liking. The templates are powered by lodash’s templating system are extremely flexible.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://oombla.com/documentation/templates\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">More</a></p><p><br></p><h2>Asset Manifest</h2><p><br></p><p>Preview the exported assets’ generated code, variant props, vector/raster check, and if they are a single color before downloading. Great for quality control when it comes to large asset sets like icons and perfect for quickly grabbing the code for a single asset.</p><p><br></p><h2>Easy to Use</h2><p><br></p><p>Programs like this can quickly become complicated to use. I’ve done my best to structure it in a way to where a normal asset setup can be exported without having to make a bunch of structural changes. If you have an organized page of assets (like a collection of icons for example) chances are you will need to make minimal changes in order to export the assets.</p><p><br></p><p>The main prerequisite is that all of your assets need to be collected into a single Frame (or Component or Instance). You can then select this Frame and all of the child nodes (basically anything besides Text layers) will be exported as individual assets.</p><p><br></p><p>The best way to experiment is to just install the plugin and give it a go.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://oombla.com/documentation/basic-operation\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">More details on how the plugin operates</a></p><p><br></p><h2>Support</h2><p><br></p><p>Running into trouble?

If you don’t want to start from scratch and want something ready-made that you can modify, Hi-Fi elements will be your BFF.<strong> </strong>All these production-ready elements can be dropped into your design with a single click (kind of like we say “it’s not you, it’s me”, hit send, and relax back into the arms of our mistresses.)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How to Use:</strong></p><ol><li>Open the Plugin</li><li>You can start with a Blueprint or just go directly for the High Fidelity UI Kit Designs</li><li>Search for your desired section such as ‘Hero’</li><li>Search for the Design that matches your vision</li><li>Drag and Drop the element to add it to your File</li><li>Tweak it according to your preferences</li><li>Take a sip of your protein shake</li><li>Unalive the population in GTA using BangBangBang</li><li>Done</li></ol><p><br></p><p>PS: There's always a <a href=\"https://getfigit.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></p>","id":"1060213973572396708","installCount":10166,"lastUpdateDate":"2022-04-19T10:10:16.807Z","likeCount":207,"name":"Figit - A massive library of UI Elements","publisherHandle":"b5d58fa5_3dc5_4","publisherId":"1060222515156818333","publisherName":"AlphaSquad","viewCount":14231},{"description":"<p><em>Life is short, make counting votes(stamps) in FigJam easier.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>How to</strong></p><ol><li>Select sticky(s) and click on the blue counting button.</li><li>Try to add some votes.

A designer will make something in Figma but the rest of the team needs to know what that component is doing, and developers will need additional information to be able to build the component. Azure Devops allows for cross team collaboration, but getting this information linked up with Figma can be a slog of a manual process. Information can quickly go out of sync, as requirements develop the design may not be updated to reflect these changes. As great a design tool Figma is, it can be difficult to navigate for the wider team.</p><p><br></p><h2>Solution</h2><p>This plugin attempts to solve some of these cross team issues by</p><ul><li>Reducing the time it takes to update content in Azure Devops when the design changes.</li><li>Creates direct links between Azure Devops items and the component in Figma they are describing.</li><li>Easily visible snapshots of components in Azure Devops that stay up to date.</li><li>Automatic version numbering of the Figma file so the version number in Figma stays up to date with the version number in Azure Devops.</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Running the plugin</h2><p><br></p><p><strong>Setting up Azure Devops</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Work items in Azure Devops need to have at least one multi line field so that the plugin can populate the images and links in the item.

Unfortunately this is a limitation of the Azure Devops api.</p><p><br></p><p>To learn more about configuring Azure Devops fields and pre populating them with a default value you can read more <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/configure-customize?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=agile-process\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. I'd recommend adding a specific field to work items, as the plugin will clear out previous content on update. Here is how you <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/configure-customize?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=agile-process#custom-fields\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">add a field in Azure Devops.</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>In Figma, you'll need Editor access to the file</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Get a link for your Azure Devops work item. The following url schema is expected</p><p><code>https://dev.azure.com/{Account}/{Project}/_workitems/edit/{ID}</code></p><p><br></p><ol><li>Protocol : https only</li><li>Domain : Will only work with dev.azure.com urls for use with the public api</li><li>Account : Azure Devops account name</li><li>Project : Azure Devops Project name</li><li>ID : Work item id</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Add this to as many components in Figma that relate to the work item in the \"Documentation Links\" field in the design view. These must be set up before the plugin is run.</p><p><br></p><p>After installing the plugin you will need access tokens associated with your Azure Devops and Figma accounts.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/developers/api\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">How to get a Figma access token</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=preview-page\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">How to get an Azure Devops access token</a> (you'll need at least the \"Work Items (read &amp; write)\" scope selected)</li></ul><p><br></p><p>There are two fields when the plugin opens for entering these access tokens.</p><p><br></p><p>If the plugin isn't installed in a private organisation, you'll also need to enter the file's unique key. To find the file's key, you can click the share button on the top panel and click the copy link. You could also copy the file ID from a browser's address bar. The File URL looks something like this</p><p><code>https://www.figma.com/file/lZv3g38KPFJKByY0rdIlG8/Sample-File</code></p><p>The file id is the value between the \"file/\" and \"/Sample-File\".</p><p><br></p><p>After establishing a successful connection you can tick the work items you'd like to update in Azure Devops. This will update the Figma file to a new version, create a URL to that version in Azure Devops along with a screenshot of the components.</p><p><br></p><p>View the tutorial <a href=\"https://youtu.be/O9Ym1lKLLHg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, including how to configure Azure Devops, get access tokens and run the plugin.</p>","id":"1062047334766899303","installCount":302,"lastUpdateDate":"2022-05-10T20:00:15.139Z","likeCount":11,"name":"Figma to Azure Devops","publisherHandle":"iamallyniam","publisherId":"2374834","publisherName":"Allyn Thomas","viewCount":1611},{"description":"<p>[100% FREE] Convert Figma layouts into responsive webpages (in HTML or Tailwind) or mobile apps (in Flutter or SwiftUI).</p><p><br></p><p>This plugin aims to raise the bar in \"design to code\" plugins by taking a new (and over-engineered) approach to optimize the layouts before the conversion even begins.

It is a format that will help you get the most out of each lesson.&nbsp;<strong>By learning - you create</strong>, and by the way, you get to know keyboard shortcuts, plugins, and techniques of working in Figma that will speed up your workflow. <strong>Everything happens in Figma</strong>&nbsp;- no distractions.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Course description</strong></h2><p>Design Systems are becoming so popular because they make products more consistent, accessible, improve their usability, and reduce design decision-making.</p><p>Nowadays, companies and individuals need to learn how to design advanced components, style guides, and documentation in Figma. Improving the workflow and onboarding the new designers to the team is also a challenge.</p><p>In Figmaster, you will learn how to create a design system from scratch in Figma. The Figmaster is purely and simply about practice, so you can start using acquired knowledge right away.</p><p>In this course, you will learn how to set up all the needed&nbsp;<strong>design tokens</strong>, such as defining proper&nbsp;<strong>grids, layouts,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>spacing</strong>, managing icons, choosing and creating&nbsp;<strong>color</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>typographic scales</strong>. You will also learn how to make the&nbsp;<strong>components</strong>&nbsp;like buttons, inputs, modals, text areas, checkboxes, notifications, radio buttons… You will learn how to name components correctly using naming conventions and translate your components into&nbsp;<strong>variants</strong>. You will also learn how to&nbsp;<strong>improve your workflow</strong>&nbsp;by using handy&nbsp;<strong>keyboard shortcuts</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>plugins</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>tricks</strong>. At the end of this course, you will create your own complete Design System and apply it anywhere&nbsp;<strong>with confidence</strong>.</p><p>In the team version, you will learn how to&nbsp;<strong>work on a design system in a team</strong>&nbsp;and how to&nbsp;<strong>onboard new designers</strong>&nbsp;with the Figmaster. I will also share resources so you can learn more about&nbsp;<strong>design systems theory</strong>&nbsp;and get inspiration from the existing systems.</p><p>We will use the full potential of Figma, making our Design System with&nbsp;<strong>variants</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>auto layout,</strong>&nbsp;and the latest Figma feature:&nbsp;<strong>interactive components</strong>. 🎉</p><p>So if you want to learn how to create a Design System from scratch in Figma,&nbsp;<strong>this is for you.</strong></p><p><br></p><h2>Module 1. Style Guide </h2><p>In the first module, we'll create design tokens and convert them into Figma Styles. We'll prepare the icon library for the entire system. We'll also set up some spacing rules that we'll follow in the next modules.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Module 2. Components </strong></h2><p>In the second module, we'll use the Styles, icons, and rules from the previous module to create the components.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Module 3. Documentation</strong></h2><p>In the third module, we'll create documentation components and frames. Then, we'll document our components and styles. In this module, you'll also learn how to make your components interactive.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Module 4. Use it</strong></h2><p>In the fourth module, we'll build a simple UI with our design system. I'll also show you how to customize it for your needs. That is, change the colors, typography, or component properties to match your product or brand requirements.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Module 5.

This plugin solves this issue with a single click.\n\nFollow these steps to hide a particular layer from all component instances\n• Select the layer/group/frame that you want to hide from one of the instances of a component\n• Select Hide Layers from Instances -> Hide\n• The selected layer/group/frame will be hidden from all instances in the current page\n\nUse the Force Hide option if the layer that you want to hide is part of a component that is nested in multiple other components and you want to hide the layer in all of them at once.\nEg.: If you want to hide a layer in an icon component that is already used in various other components like different state and sizes of buttons, then Hide option will just hide the layer in the selected state or size of the button. Whereas Force Hide will hide the layer in all the instances of all the components that this icon is used.\n\nThis plugin works only on instances and not on components\nCAUTION: When using the Force Hide option. ensure that the name of the layer you are hiding is unique. If not, multiple layers may get hidden.\n\nFeels too small a feature for a plugin? There is also a Scripter File for this that you can use. https://www.figma.com/community/file/858014268242545394/Hide-Layers-from-Instances\n\nDo let us know if you want any additional features. We'll try adding it.

No exports, copying and pasting files, no code cleaning or additional optimizations. \n\nFor developers: Imagine that you receive a bunch of icons from your fellow designer. You have to extract needed data from all those SVG files... It's time consuming... Forget about it. Now you can easily export all icons data to a JSON file with one click! If you have a custom Icon component in React, Angular or Vue — that's all you need.\n\nHow it works:\n1. Create frames / components / instances with unique names (plugin seeks for every frame / components / instances in a current page)\n2. Draw icons or paste them from your favorite tool (like IconJar)\n3. Flatten them (if they are not already)\n4. Use the plugin to create a JSON with needed data\n5. Use data with your custom Icon component\n6. 🎉\n\nTip! Hidden frames, components or instances are skipped by the plugin\n\n=========================\nCustom components & examples:\n1.

It lets you animate your Figma designs quickly: import your pixel-perfect frames in 1 click, add animations in a few seconds, customize everything, and export the animation as a video, GIF or Lottie. You can also create your motion design system with animated components and animation styles you can reuse on all your layers, and let developers inspect animation parameters.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>What is Jitter?</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://jitter.video?utm_source=figma&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_id=figma-plugin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Jitter</a> is an easy-to-use animation tool on the web. It's like Figma, but for motion design: we enable creators to design stunning animated content and interfaces, with their teams. Jitter is a modern alternative to After Effects, with no learning curve: it's fast, easy, collaborative, and you can export your animations as HD video (60 fps), GIF or Lottie.</p><p><br></p><h2>How to use the plugin</h2><ol><li>Open the plugin</li><li>Select a frame, and click the “Export” button</li><li>Open the project in Jitter and create some magic! ✨</li></ol><h2><br></h2><h2>FAQ</h2><p><strong>What kind of animations can I do with Jitter?</strong></p><p>Whether you are designing an app, a website, an illustration, a presentation video, a social media post, an Instagram Story, a YouTube intro, or anything else, you can import your design into Jitter in 1 click and animate right away. We are a design tool like Figma, so we give you total control over the parameters: your imagination is the limit.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Can I animate text?</strong></p><p>Yes, text animation is actually our specialty: you can put a text in motion with an animation preset, and then customize several parameters like speed, duration, easing – and more importantly, you can choose if you want to animate letter by letter, word by word, or line by line.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Can I design micro-interactions?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can animate all the basic properties of your layers and masks (position, size, rotation, scale, opacity, corner radius, shadow…).</p><h2><br></h2><p><strong>What format can I export to?</strong></p><p>You can export your animated designs as HD videos (1080p, 60 fps), GIF, and Lottie.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Can I export my Figma design to Lottie?</strong></p><p>Yes, Jitter actually the best workflow to do that today: you can import your Figma designs in 1 click with this plugin, add your animations in Jitter, and export to Lottie format. You can include your Lottie animations to your apps, websites, Webflow projects, LottieFiles workspace…</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How are you different from other plugins?</strong></p><p>We use a unique way to make animations: After Effects and most animations plugins (Motion, Figmotion, Aninix, SVG Motion, Bannerify and the other Figmatic plugins…) use the traditional keyframe system. Instead, we use an animation model where we give <strong><em>instructions</em></strong> to the layers (like “Slide in”, “Fade out”…): building an animation is more intuitive, and the timeline is easy to read. Building an animation with Jitter is as simple as building an animation in PowerPoint or Keynote, but you have total control over the parameters.</p><h2><br></h2><p><strong>How do I handoff the animation to the developers?</strong></p><p>You can share the project URL, so that your developers can inspect the animation parameters. We know this is a common use case, so we plan to develop the animation inspector further for easy handoff, and to build your own motion design system.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Does it support all features from Figma?</strong></p><p>Our priority is to make a pixel-perfect import. We support most Figma properties natively. For layers that are too complex to be supported in Jitter, we convert the layer to a PNG or SVG. That way, you always get a pixel-perfect import.</p><p>Here are the known limitations:</p><ul><li>Rich texts (multiple colors or font weight in the same text layer) and Variable fonts are exported as images</li><li>Elements with gradient fills, multiple fills, strokes, multiple shadows or effects are exported as images</li><li>Only simple masks are supported in Jitter (when the masking layer is the last layer of the group) – in all other cases, mask groups are exported as images</li><li>Blend modes are not supported in Jitter</li><li>Individual strokes are not supported</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Can I import multiple artboards?</strong></p><p>At the moment, you can only import one artboard / frame at a time. We will add support for multiple artboards / frames in the future.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>I found a bug, what should I do?</strong></p><p>If you encounter any bugs, please reach out to us and we'll be able to fix it rapidly :) You can contact us at <a href=\"mailto:figma.plugin@jitter.video\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">figma.plugin@jitter.video</a>, or on our website <a href=\"https://jitter.video\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">https://jitter.video</a>.</p>","id":"961270034818256057","installCount":42185,"lastUpdateDate":"2022-05-25T10:18:35.446Z","likeCount":915,"name":"Jitter · Animate your Figma designs","publisherHandle":"jittervideo","publisherId":"959755238084347779","publisherName":"Jitter","viewCount":77887},{"description":"<p>Easily map your data and layers together by using the same name.

Our design team has been slowly pulling our color libraries into Figma, and early on in the process, we realized this was a long and tedious task. Because the color themes for the products we work on can be quite extensive, manually creating color styles and a visual color guide takes a lot of time. We decided that Microsoft's Hackathon 2019 would be an excellent opportunity to team up and try and fix this problem. Over the course of three days, we built Kaleidocode to address the gap in our workflow and improve the design process not only for our team but anyone else designing for VS Code.</p><p><br></p><p>Kaleidocode's creators are Kaitlin Wilkinson, Miguel Solorio, and Pine Wu.</p>","id":"736060893363678891","installCount":3793,"lastUpdateDate":"2019-08-02T23:58:07.001Z","likeCount":54,"name":"Kaleidocode","publisherHandle":"microsoft","publisherId":"1500","publisherName":"Microsoft","viewCount":3161},{"description":"<h2>With Keyboard Doodler, you can draw with your keyboard!</h2><p><br></p><p>Why would I want this?

I became tired of manually applying export settings across assets and projects.

I became tired of manually applying export settings across assets and projects. So this was born March 21st, locked up in my apartment.\n\n⚡️ Lazy Export allows the user to apply default export settings to selected objects in Figma.\n\n🧠 How does it work?\nThere are two ways to trigger your export settings to be applied. The first is a window giving you UI access to run the plugin commands. (Set Platform, Apply Settings, Clear Settings)\nThe second is via the plugin menu; this makes the actions searchable in Figma with the `⌘+/` command.\n\n🔧  Currently supported:\n• IOS \n• IOS Adv.\n• Android\n• Android Adv.\n• Web\n\n📦 Export Options\n\n✨ Export Settings\nWith Lazy export, you have two mobile options on how you can apply export settings.\n\n• Default Export\n• Advanced Export\n\nWith the default export, this follows the trends for exporting assets for mobile at the different screen densities. Advanced is still being worked on for a smooth workflow.\n\nℹ️ The end goal for Advanced Export Options, would be for a developer to hit apply, and Figma exports a folder of assets the developer can drop into Android Studio or Xcode.\n\nAndroid Suffix\n`drawable-mdpi`\n\nIOS Suffix\n`/default-asset@1x`\n\nAndroid Advance Suffix\n`/drawable-mdpi/default-asset`\n\nIOS Advance Suffix\n`/default-asset.imageset/default-asset@1x`\n\n✍️ Custom Asset Naming\n\nRight now, if you do not apply a custom name to each asset, a default one will be used. \n    📆 I have plans on the roadmap to adjust this.\n\nDefault Name String = `default-asset`\n\n🐛 Have a feature request or bug?

When you specify the padding values in the component name you can change the elements inside the component and apply the paddings in one click. The component will automatically resize itself so that it surrounds all other elements within the component according to padding values.\n\nSpecify the padding values within the component group or frame name. E.g. button [12 24]. The format of the padding values is in the same order as CSS.\n\n❖ FEATURES\n✅ Paddi works with Groups, Frames, Components, Libraries.\n✅ Paddi is simple! The only thing you need to do is specify the paddings in the component name\n✅ Recognize components with paddings looking at their names. ⚡️ It works the same as in CSS.\n✅ Paddi is flexible. No limitation there, set the same padding for all sides [12] or different for each one [12 24 14 32].\n✅ Paddi uses a base element as a parent and calculates paddings from it.\n✅ Speed up your workflow! You don’t need to open plugin settings all the time you need to update paddings. You only need to rename the component and run the Paddi.\n✅ Natural master & instance behavior. If you change master component paddings, you don’t need to do anything else to update instances, Paddi will update all instances automatically.\n✅ Paddi works with libraries. Create a master component in your library file and apply the padding for all its instances in any project file. ⚠️ If you change padding for the master component in the library you will have to update all instances in the other files manually.\n\n❖ PADDINGS\nPadding values sets by clockwise from top to left sides. It works the same as in CSS. Examples:\n- [12] - padding for all sides - 12px\n- [12 24] - top&bottom - 12px, right&left - 24 px\n- [12 24 32] - top - 12px, right&left - 24px, bottom - 32px\n- [12 24 32 16] - top - 12px, right - 24px, bottom - 32px, left - 16px\n\n❖ FORMATS\nWe recommend to use space for separating padding values to keep it simple, however, you can use a comma as well. Examples:\n- [12 24]\n- [12, 24, 24, 12]\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A GROUP\n1. Create a rectangle. This element will be the base of the component\n2. Put some text or another shape inside the rectangle\n3. Group these elements\n4. Select the Group and whether rename the Group by adding e.g. [16 32] at the end of the name or just run Paddi to apply the default values - [12 24]\n5. Change text or resize elements inside the Group\n6. Select the Group and run Paddi again to apply the paddings\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A FRAME\n1. Write some text or create a shape\n2. Wrap it with a Frame\n3. ⚠️ In case you have only one element in the Frame the paddings will calculate from the Frame to its element. ⚠️ In case you have more than 1 element inside the Frame and want to use this Frame as the base you need to wrap all its elements with a Group\n4. Select the Frame and whether rename the Frame by adding e.g. [16 32] at the end of the name or just run Paddi to apply the default values - [12 24]\n5. Change text or resize elements inside the Frame\n6. Select the Frame and run Paddi again to apply the paddings\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A COMPONENT\n1. After you have a Group with some paddings create a master component from it\n2. Set constraints for the master component to make sure its instances will responsive correctly. Set Scale for the base and make sure all other elements have Left and Top\n3. Change elements and run Paddi. ⚠️ Because you can’t change elements position in an instance you will be able to change only the text elements and then apply the paddings\n\n❖ IGNORE\nTo ignore some elements in your component, rename the necessary ones with [ignore] or [nopaddi] at the end of its name.\n\n❖ IMPORTANT TO KNOW\n⚠️ The lowest element in a group or frame is going to be the base of the component! So don't forget to add a base.\n⚠️ The base element in your component will be marked as (base) in the layer name.\n⚠️ You can’t change paddings for instance because you can’t change its elements positioning. To handle it, go to the master component or detach the instance.\n⚠️ If you want to set a Frame as a base and specify paddings for it, wrap all elements inside this frame in a group to have only one element in the frame and then apply Paddi.\n\n❖ WHERE TO USE\n✅ Buttons\n✅ Tab items\n✅ Navigation items\n✅ Dropdown menus\n✅ Tags / Pils / Badges\n✅ Tooltips / Popovers\n✅ Icons\n✅ UI Cards\n✅ Modal dialogs\n✅ Sections\n✅ Etc.\n\n❖ SHORTCUT FOR MAC OS\nTo speed up your workflow add a shortcut to Paddi. It takes a minute to set up but keeps a lot of time later on.\nOpen System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts tab -> App Shortcuts -> Add new:\n1. Application: Figma\n2. Menu Title: Paddi\n3.

A few features are missing before you will be able to use it for production work. Sorry for the wait, and thanks for your patience!</p><p><br></p><p>If you do try it out please write to us at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:hello@protoship.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">hello@protoship.io</a>&nbsp;and we'll be happy to help you get the most out of Decode.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>A Novel Design-to-Code Solution</strong></h2><p>Protoship Decode is a novel design-to-code tool that generates HTML &amp; Tailwind CSS from Figma designs. It is novel because it is a specialized HTML editor rather than a fully automated solution. That is a significant departure from all existing design-to-code tools, including our own previous attempts.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Hand-coded output</strong></h2><p>We had the following sometimes conflicting goals while designing it:</p><ol><li>Generate code indistinguishable from hand-coded output by an expert programmer.</li><li>Get the developer to be intimately familiar with the generated code, so they can modify and integrate it as their own.</li><li>Eliminate the slow, painstaking work of inspecting the design, measuring paddings and margins, and manually writing CSS by hand.</li><li>Accept any design file with zero to little modifications. Do not depend on the design's layer organization.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>This is how Decode solves it: Decode offers the front-end developer an HTML editor along with the mockup of the design side-by-side. They can write the minimal amount of markup needed for the design in the editor. To insert design elements, you can point them out with a two letter shortcode from the design mockup, and Decode will do the rest. It will figure out all the CSS properties of the element, layout it using paddings and margins, and insert it into the markup with Tailwind classes.</p><p><br></p><p>With this, the developer can quickly hammer out a design by just writing its markup, and everything else is done for them by Decode. It speeds up the design-to-code flow substantially, while producing hand-coded output that the user themselves had a hand in writing.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h2><p>There are however two downsides with this approach:</p><ol><li>It is not fully automated. There is no magic button to go from a design to high-quality production-ready code.</li><li>To use the tool, one should know enough HTML &amp; CSS to be able to implement their design by themselves. Decode just eliminates a lot of manual effort, but the decision-making on how to structure the markup is left with the developer.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>For now this means UI/UX designers may find it challenging to use the tool without brushing up on some front-end development skills.</p><p><br></p>","id":"946302419384017787","installCount":166,"lastUpdateDate":"2022-06-03T15:58:56.547Z","likeCount":1,"name":"Protoship Decode: HTML+Tailwind for Figma","publisherHandle":"jasim_ab","publisherId":"41336","publisherName":"Jasim A Basheer","viewCount":267},{"description":"<h2>Quick prototyping of design projects</h2><p><br></p><p>So far this is the first version of the plugin and the functionality is not great, but you can fix it!

Select 2+ layers. Also if you select only one group or frame plugin will work the same way as you selected all its children, so you don't have to do it manually (there still have to be 2 or more children though)\n\n2. Choose the number of columns and gaps between rows and columns. The gap amount would be also saved for the next use.\n\n3. Click \"Change\" or hit Enter. Done!\n\nPro tips:\n• A plugin is aware of initial layer positions (top to bottom, left to right), so if you need to squeeze in one more block and push the rest of them down just place its top-left corner in right place and rerun the plugin. \n\n• It's especially easy to place everything in one row, as the plugin will suggest a total amount of selected layers as the number of columns. Just Call the plugin and hit Enter.","id":"753298710088509926","installCount":16828,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-04-20T01:25:09.861Z","likeCount":252,"name":"Quantizer","publisherHandle":"vadim","publisherId":"779","publisherName":"Vadim Pleshkov","viewCount":11429},{"description":"<h2>Figma to React with Quest</h2><p><br></p><p>The better way to build your front end.

To open this menu on Mac, use <strong>Cmd + / </strong>or <strong>Cmd + P</strong>. On Windows, use <strong>Ctrl + /</strong> or <strong>Ctrl + P</strong>. With this menu open, you can type a command and hit enter to quickly generate random numbers.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[-] Type a valid prefix before the command</strong></p><p><strong>‣ g </strong>| For example: <strong>g</strong>100 / <strong>g</strong>thousand / <strong>g </strong>saved</p><p><strong>‣ rng </strong>| For example: <strong>rng </strong>10000 / <strong>rng</strong> million / <strong>rng</strong> saved</p><p><strong>‣ random </strong>| For example: <strong>random</strong>10 / <strong>random</strong> hundred / <strong>random</strong>saved</p><p><strong>‣ num </strong>| For example: <strong>num </strong>1000000 / <strong>num</strong>hundredthousand / <strong>num</strong>saved</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ [-]10, [-]100, ... , [-]1000000</strong></p><p>This will generate random numbers for all selected text layers between 1 and whatever amount of zeros you typed. For example, pressing <strong>Cmd + /, </strong>typing <strong>g100000, </strong>and hitting <strong>Enter</strong> will generate numbers between 1 - 100,000.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ [-] ten, [-] hundred, ... , [-] million</strong></p><p>This has the same functionality as the above, but you can type the name of the number instead. For example, pressing <strong>Cmd + /, </strong>typing <strong>random ten, </strong>and hitting <strong>Enter</strong> will generate numbers between 1 - 10.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ [-] saved</strong></p><p>This will generate numbers from your saved range. By default, this will be 1 through 50, but you can change it in the plugin UI. For example, pressing <strong>Cmd + /, </strong>typing <strong>rng saved, </strong>and hitting <strong>Enter</strong> will generate numbers between <em>Custom X</em> -<em> Custom Y</em>.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>⚙️ Using the plugin UI</strong></h2><p>Open up the plugin UI by navigating to it in your Plugins dropdown, or open up the quick actions menu (Cmd + /) and type <strong>rng settings</strong>. In the plugin settings window, you can do the following:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ Modify your saved range</strong></p><p>Set up your minimum and maximum to generate your random numbers from. You can go really high (into the billions), so go wild. The plugin will remember this range, and you can also quickly generate new numbers from your saved range without the plugin open. See <strong>[-] saved</strong> above.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ Rapidly generate numbers</strong></p><p>Keep clicking \"Randomize\" or hitting the Enter key and you'll regenerate numbers for all your selected text layers. Keep going until you see a set of numbers that is perfect.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ Toggle the \"Only replace existing numbers\" setting </strong>(Off by default)</p><p>Decide whether to replace the entire contents of a selected text layer with a generated number, or scan through the layer and replace any numbers found with newly generated number. Text layers without numbers in them will not be affected.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ Toggle the \"Prevent Duplicate\" setting </strong>(Off by default)</p><p>Decide whether to prevent duplicate numbers when generating numbers. This is a good way to generate unique sets of numbers or randomize list order. If the amount of numbers you are generating exceeds the amount you define in your range, the plugin will need to generate some duplicates.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ Toggle the \"Format with commas\" setting </strong>(On by default)</p><p>Decide whether to show commas for numbers above 999. For example, you'd want to toggle this on if you're generating regular numbers, but you might want to toggle it off if you're generating numbers for a data centric UI or a random list of years (2021 vs 2,021).</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>☕️ Support the plugin</strong></h2><p>If you love the plugin and feel inclined to provide some small financial support to encourage the development of new features and bug fixes, that would be greatly appreciated.

If the top leftmost object among the selected is a group or a frame, all the text layers inside it will be placed in the list of inputs first, and so on.</p><p>• Now you can copy multiple layers from inputs. When you press Cmd+Shift+C texts from the currently selected input and all inputs down from it will be copied to clipboard with new lines as delimiters.</p><p>• Now tabs also work as delimiters with multiline paste. With that, you can copy-paste rows from Google Sheets and other places.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Added in version 10:</strong></h2><p>• Now the plugin finally works correctly on Windows! Had to implement some tricky logic handling new lines on Windows, and now everything should work as expected.</p><p>• Starting from this version, the plugin preserves the name of the layer when changing the text.

This process can take 5-15 minutes depending on the number and size of your files. Occasionally it might take longer. Keep in mind this means that some of the information in your Figma files will be stored on an external server.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Q: Is our data secure?</strong></p><p><strong>A: </strong>Yes, indexes are created separately for each team and cannot be accessed publicly.

Primary600? That name doesn't mean much. PrimaryButtonLabel? That's clear as can be.\n\nThis plugin makes it simple to maintain a collection of semantically named colors that derive their color from your base palette. Not only does this allow you to increase clarity of usage, it also lays the foundation necessary for theming within your apps. \n\nFor more details on why you should implement your colors this way, read this blog post:\nhttps://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7\n\nUsing Semantic Color Sync is simple. First, create your base palette. For each base palette color, add a consistent prefix, such as “.palette/”\n\nNext, create a series of semantically named colors. In the description for each semantically named color, add the base palette color it derives from (including the prefix). For example: “.palette/primary600”\n\nNext, when you decide to change your primary hue from blue to bright pink (good choice, btw), the Semantic Color Sync plugin will automatically search through every semantically named color and update their color to match the updates made in your base palette. \n\nNo need to update things by hand... Ugh. Just tweak your base palette and run this plugin to propagate the changes throughout all of your semantically named colors!\n\nAnd again, if you’re curious why this is useful, this blog post has it all laid out: \nhttps://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7","id":"748971588750337968","installCount":1509,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-02-27T18:44:48.679Z","likeCount":82,"name":"Semantic Color Sync","publisherHandle":"YNAB","publisherId":"1890","publisherName":"Product","viewCount":3577},{"description":"<p>Simplified <a href=\"https://semver.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Semantic Versioning</a> for your Figma Nodes without external dependencies and consumable via API.</p><h2><br></h2><p>Features:</p><ul><li>Guided Semantic Versioning for your Nodes.</li><li>Issue Figma Document-Versions alongside the node versions.</li><li>History (and undo) the versioning.</li><li>Commit Messages</li><li>Consumable version information via Figma REST-API</li></ul><p><br></p><p>This plugin intents to help you keeping track of changes to your design by simply attaching a version number to your nodes.</p><p><br></p><p>The version number might be used to indicate the expected backend work triggered by the current design changes.</p><p><br></p><p>And it also allows you to reference the version in other tools and assets like issue trackers and documentation.</p><p><br></p><p>This plugin has&nbsp;<strong>no</strong>&nbsp;external dependencies, the version information is saved in the current document.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Be aware the meaning of the word \"backend\" depends highly on your project setup.

As you might assume this will break the current implementation of the app using this design because the app actually works with that input and might expect a value attached to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Propagating this change will likely break the backend-implementation. You communicate this by increasing the major release number by one actually saying this is a backward-incompatible change. And you expect it to break the current implementation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>MINOR</strong></p><p>The MINOR-release number increase marks a&nbsp;backward-compatible&nbsp;change of your design, usually by adding a feature.</p><p><br></p><p>Imagine you extended the functionality of a frame by changing the design to display an additional input element. While this will require backend work to make the input actually work, rolling out the design won't break the application. So that is a backward compatible change of the current design.</p><p><br></p><p>Increasing the MINOR release version communicates you added a change which might require backend work but won't break the current backend implementation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>PATCH</strong></p><p>The PATCH-release number increase marks a simple fix of your design which does not require any backend work.</p><p><br></p><p>Let's say you adjust some colors or got a ticket telling you a responsiveness feature isn't working as expected. By fixing this you correct the intentional implementation of the current design.</p><p><br></p><p>By using the PATCH version number you communicate there is no change in the backend-interface of your design and it won't require any backend changes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>RFC</strong></p><p>Depending on your surrounding development process you might not be able to decide on your own when a design is ready to release. In this case you may enable the \"request for comments\"-based workflow.</p><p><br></p><p>The Rfc-workflow adds a&nbsp;<code>-rfc.1</code>-label to the version reflecting the current iteration in your approval process.</p><p><br></p><p>Let's say you make a first draft of a form, since it's a minor change, you choose to add a minor-change and because you have the rfc-workflow enabled you're only minor release option (given your current version is&nbsp;<code>1.0.0</code>) is&nbsp;<code>1.1.0-rfc.1</code>. This communicates you drafted a first version of the intended minor change.</p><p>Your team then discusses your draft and gives you some feedback which requires changes. After these changes you increase the Rfc number resulting in&nbsp;<code>1.1.0-rfc.2</code>. After another discussion with your team all are fine with the changes and you release the design to&nbsp;<code>1.1.0</code>.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>How to use the Settings?</h2><p>The settings are saved per document.

When you save a version on a node, an&nbsp;<code>@</code>-symbol will be added to node name (if it not already exists) and the saved version is appended to the name.</p><p><br></p><p>This feature also adds two more version options \"From Appendix\" and \"To Appendix\" to the user interface (if the version appendix and the internal version of that node differ) allowing you to f.e. manually set or remove the version.

Let's say you want to export an url to your frame listed as a row in the csv. You could add a custom column and set its value to \"${url}\".

This plugin makes it easy with the magic of optical character recognition.\n\nKNOWN PROBLEMS\n* If you attempt to run the plugin on a static image larger than 1MB with a free API key, it will silently fail. Working on an error message right now.\n* Current workaround: resize the image to a smaller size, copy as PNG, paste it back onto the cavnas, rerun the plugin on the new, smaller image.\n* Alternatively, you can upgrade your API key to the paid tier at OCR.Space.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n* This plugin takes advantage of the free API offered by OCR.Space (https://ocr.space). You'll need to acquire your own free API key here: https://ocr.space/OCRAPI#free\n* Copy your API key and paste it into the plugin.\n* Once your key is saved, select a layer with a static image as a fill, and run the plugin\n* After a brief delay, the text will be copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n* You can only select one layer at a time currently\n* If an image has more than one image fill, it will only work for the top one\n* As a quirk of how the plugin was made, you will briefly see a non-interactive window pop up. This allows for content to be added to your clipboard.\n* In addition, the same limitations that apply to OCR.Space's API free tier applies obviously to this plugin, such as file size limit, and rate limiting. See full info here: https://ocr.space/OCRAPI\n\nThis plugin is 100% open source.

This plugin will do it for you!\n\nThis plugin will let you do this:\n\n1. Manage style references on a selected node\n2. Auto-update all references as you change origins (keep the plugin open for this)\n3. Export references to make it available for third-party consumers\n4. Switch contexts\n\n# 1. Manage References\n\nSelect a node for which you want to manage references, eg. a rectangle. Open the \"Style References\" plugin and a dialog will appear that let you do it. Currently these styles are supported:\n\n- Fill Style\n- Stroke Style\n- Effect Style\n\nFor each of those there is a section in the dialog where you can manage the origin style to the reference.\n\n- **Origin** That's the _original_ style.\n- **Reference** That's the style to which the origin is copied over when references are updated.\n\n## Transforms\n\nFor paint styles (Fill and Stroke) transforms are available. When styles\nare referenced from origin to reference you can put transforms in between.\nAvailabe are HSL + Opacity values. They will be applied during\nreferencing.\n\nUse this to automate your color palette. Make one color swatch for your\nbase value (e.g. \"Brand / 500\"). A darker color would take your base value as\nreference and set lightness to \"-20\" - name it for example \"Brand / 300\".\n\n# 2. Export\n\nYou can export your references to jsonbin.io and by that make it available for third-party consumers, e.g. if you want to update your design tokens in your code. Here is how:\n\nEnter credentials in settngs:\n\n1. Create an account and copy the API Key\n2. Create a bin and copy the bin URL\n\nOn the tools tab the `Export Settings` button becomes available. Clicking the button will export your references.\n\n# 3. Import\n\nYou can import your earlier exported references from jsonbin.io. That is really helpful when you duplicated your document - figma will not copy over your stored references. Here is how to import references:\n\n1. Duplicate a document\n2. Open the old document, open the plugin, go to settings and copy the Bin URL\n3. Go the new new document (the plugin should still be opened), paste the URL into the input for import and click the button next to it.\n4. A notification will appear telling you how much references were imported.\n5. You can work with your new document the same way as the old one now - win!\n\n# 4. Contexts\n\nContexts are a lightweight way to organize various theme modes within one document. E.g. if you have light and dark mode in one document, you may want to give styles for respective styles a specific suffix, e.g. `.$dark` - With defined contexts, you can swap between them quickly and then use Themer to export them.\n\n## Workflow Suggestion\n\nUse it in combination with Themer:\n\n1. Set your variants for each context (`§light` and `§dark`)\n2. Select a context\n3. Use `Style References` to map those \"compiled\" styles\n4. Use `Themer` to export and apply them\n\n### Things to Know\n\n- When setting the origin style the suggestions only show local styles, that is also due to limitations of the current figma API, given security reasons for shared team libraries. That's fair - figma keeps us safe, give them credit for that :)\n\nIt still is possible to use library styles, then you can't use the style references manage dialog, instead manually assign those style and THEN use the style references dialog in order to persist it.\n\n- Once you have one node \"under management\", you may want to change the local style but once you update references, those new ones will be overridden. Re-select the node again and the references dialog will provide you options for migrating styles, to either keep the old one or use the new one.\n\n- Once you link origin to reference the node itself will show the reference as its local style, which might give you wonders, yet is expected and the correct behavior.","id":"791262205400516364","installCount":1623,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-06-07T12:13:14.648Z","likeCount":49,"name":"Theemo - Style Automator","publisherHandle":"gossi","publisherId":"891","publisherName":"Thomas Gossmann","viewCount":4437},{"description":"<p>⭐️️ Help you generate sys tokens for all themes, based on the token links from a full theme.</p><ul><li>ref color example: [themeName]/ref/blue-50</li><li>sys color example: [themeName]/sys/primary</li></ul><p><br></p><p>👋🏻️ Steps to use this plugin:</p><ol><li>Create a full theme (ref &amp; sys) in color style, make sure the folder dir matching the structure above.</li><li>Create other theme's ref color palette.</li><li>Choose the full theme as the basic theme, the plugin will automatically get token links.</li><li>Click 'generate' to generate sys tokens based on the token links for all themes.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>✨️ Tips:</p><ol><li>'generate' will skip theme which already have sys folder, so you don't have to create empty sys folder.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>📣️ New Feature:</p><ul><li>Importing color styles from external palette(eg. <a href=\"https://colors.eva.design/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">eva color palette</a>) via JSON file.</li></ul>","id":"1078279010891577195","installCount":305,"lastUpdateDate":"2022-03-25T06:35:34.945Z","likeCount":5,"name":"theme color token","publisherHandle":"biasia","publisherId":"104714","publisherName":"BIAsia","viewCount":1605},{"description":"<p>Browse and search all the CSS custom properties for plugin and widget UIs in real time.</p>","id":"1104533141442501061","installCount":122,"lastUpdateDate":"2022-05-10T17:07:02.636Z","likeCount":5,"name":"Theme Colors Inspector","publisherHandle":"figmajake","publisherId":"1060622139825576127","publisherName":"Jake Albaugh","viewCount":217},{"description":"<p>Theme Composer is a Figma plugin that allows you to create a complete website with<strong> Figma + HTML5 and CSS</strong> without writing a single line of code.</p><h2><br></h2><h2><strong>Theme Composer Tutorial:</strong></h2><p>1 - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TPeyYGTOP3M\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Landing Page Design From Figma to HTML</a></p><p>2 - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyEcF0vxvVQ&amp;ab_channel=RaoufBelakhdar\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">How to design a landing page for your eBook</a></p><p>3 - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_k7k8wPFXE&amp;t=8s&amp;ab_channel=RaoufBelakhdar\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Course Landing Page Design From Figma To Html</a></p><p>4 - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmLVw15IPUI&amp;t=100s&amp;ab_channel=RaoufBelakhdar\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Law Firm Landing Page Design From Figma To Html</a></p><p><br></p><h2>UI Library</h2><p>From hero sections and contact forms - we've created 150 Elements that you can use to build a website straight away.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>150 Ui Elements</li><li>50 Landing Pages</li><li>Figma Auto layout</li><li>Color and Text Styles</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>HTML Previewer</h2><p>Convert every User Interface in the <strong>UI Library</strong> to <strong>HTML </strong>easily.</p><ul><li>HTML 5 + CSS 3</li><li>Bootstrap 5</li><li>SASS Included</li><li>Fully Responsive</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Home Page: </strong><a href=\"https://figmaland.com/uikit/theme-composer\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">T</a><a href=\"https://captain-design.com/plugin/theme-composer\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">heme Composer</a></p>","id":"1031231406409957685","installCount":3886,"lastUpdateDate":"2022-04-12T18:12:03.430Z","likeCount":70,"name":"Theme Composer","publisherHandle":"raoufBelakhdar","publisherId":"2998302","publisherName":"Raouf Belakhdar","viewCount":6278},{"description":"<p>Crie templates das suas features e rapidamente mude para o tema desejado.</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Crie os componentes com propriedade específicas de estilo/brand.</li><li>Selecione os frames desejados e inicie o plugin.</li><li>Escolha a propriedade desejada e alterne os valores chave.</li><li>Feito!

Use it for color, text and effect styles.\n\nHow does it work?\nThemer associates published styles with a theme name. When you have multiple themes, Themer will swap styles that match across themes: which means you need two styles with the same names in each theme.\n\nIn order for Themer to be used across your team, generic information about your styles is shared on a external service (jsonbin.io). You will need an account with an API key to get started (You can easily sign in with Google, GutHub or Twitter).\n\nWatch the setup video on YouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM8SkksBy3Y&feature=youtu.be\n\n1. Insert your API key from JSONbin\n\n2. Create your first theme, giving it a unique name, and then choose where you want to pull the styles from (all local styles, styles used on the page, or a selection).\n\n*Tip*: If all of your styles exist within one document, you can also prefix your style names with 'theme1/' or 'theme2/' and set Themer to generate multiuple themes at once.\n\n3. With your themes created, you can now apply them to a selection or the entire page. Remember, your design must make use of the same styles from one of the themes to work.\n\nPrivacy:\nThemer stores information about your styles at a service external to Figma. For each theme, we store the name of the theme, the name of the style, the type of style (color, text, effect), and a unique key required to import your styles into a document from your team library. No other data from your file is sent to Jsonbin. Your unique API key is storred locally as well, so if you use Themer across devices, between team members, or between Figma Desktop and Figma in the browser, you will need to re-enter your API key and your Bin URL so that everyone/everywhere has access to the same list of Themes.\n\nRemember to publish your styles before creating a Theme :)\n\nRoadmap:\n• Currently Themer does not yet work text boxes which contan multiple text styles, the plan is to enable this in the near future","id":"731176732337510831","installCount":37126,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-05-07T01:19:38.961Z","likeCount":801,"name":"Themer","publisherHandle":"tom","publisherId":"35","publisherName":"Tom","viewCount":57407},{"description":"A Figma plugin that lets you import, lit, use and render 3D models right there in Figma 🙈\n\nWatch the video https://youtu.be/XRP-9JM7h4A to see how to use the Third plugin for Figma.\n\n💡 Features\n-   ⚡ A viewport to interact with 3D models.\n-   🔥 High resolution and transparent rendering.\n-   😽 Easy to use UI.\n-   ✨ Supports multiple 3D Object model format for import.\n-   🚀 Lightweight.\n\n🤔 TODOS\nAdd support for postprocessing effects such as\n* Color grading.\n* Bloom.\n* Vignette and Dither.","id":"772499949564209716","installCount":6130,"lastUpdateDate":"2019-12-14T21:54:33.053Z","likeCount":141,"name":"Third","publisherHandle":"victor_aremu","publisherId":"203619","publisherName":"Victor Aremu","viewCount":8075},{"description":"<p>Apply simple Threshold Effect Filter on images.

Make sure that you have access to at least one organization and one project in Transifex.</p><p>2. Install the “Transifex Figma Plugin” in your Figma app.</p><p>3. Open your Figma file.</p><p>4. Go to plugins and select “Transifex Figma Plugin”.</p><p>6. Add your Transifex credentials in the “Settings” tab: First you need to connect with Transifex using an API token. Generate this token from your Transifex account under User Settings =&gt; API token. After generating the token, copy and paste it in the related input box in the Figma plugin and click “Connect”.</p><p><br></p><p>You should complete the following plugin settings after connecting with Transifex:</p><p>Organization: the desired organization to work with.</p><p>Project: the desired project that these Figma strings will be associated with.</p><p>Resource: the desired resource of the selected project to push strings to. If you don’t have any resources you can try to create one using the action “Create a new resource” (note that you should have the adequate permissions in order to perform this action).</p><p><br></p><p>After setting the options, click “Save”.</p><p><br></p><p>Using the plugin</p><p><br></p><p>1. Start selecting the Figma layers that you want to send, or “push”, to your Transifex resource for translation.</p><p>2. Your selection will collect your text layers as strings in the main window of the plugin, under both the “Push strings to Transifex” and “Pull strings from Transifex” tabs.</p><p>3. To remove any unwanted strings from the selection in the “Push” or “Pull” tabs, click the X to the right of the string. That string will be removed from the current selection list.</p><p>4. Click the “Push” button to send the selected strings to Transifex and add them to the connected resource. After pushing the strings you can check to see that they were successfully sent using the “View resource in Transifex” link. Also you have the option to upload screenshots if you have selected “Upload Screenshots”. The strings will be translated according to the workflow set up in the Transifex project.</p><p>5. By default the plugin will automatically generate screenshots of your Figma frames and include them with the pushed strings in Transifex. The strings for translation will be automatically mapped to the screenshots in Transifex to provide visual context of your Figma designs to your translators and ensure the quality of the translation. Optionally you can disable screenshot generation for any string push by deselecting the “Upload Screenshots” checkbox in the “Push Strings to Transifex” tab.</p><p>6. You can use the “Replace Resource Strings” feature to clean extra or outdated strings out of your Transifex resources. if this option is checked when you click the “Push” button to send strings to Transifex, then all of the strings currently in the connected resource will be purged and replaced with the current selection only. This option should be used carefully, especially with resources shared by other users. If you are sure you want to replace all the strings in the resource with the current selection, click “OK” in the confirmation dialog. The resource strings will be replaced, and the “Replace” option will be reset to deactivated. All of your previous translations remain in the translation memory (TM) so you and your team can reuse them, unless they are also deleted from the TM in Transifex.</p><p>7. To pull translations back from Transifex to Figma, first select the Figma layers you want to get translations for and then click the “Pull” button in the “Pull Strings from Transifex” tab. You have the option to pull them in all languages or in a specific one by selecting it in the “Language” dropdown. The pull operation will create a new page in your Figma file for every language with the same name of the selected page and the language code as prefix, and automatically insert translations for the selected strings.</p><p><br></p><p>About Transifex</p><p>Founded in Greece and now headquartered in Silicon Valley, Transifex helps companies - from Startups to the Enterprise - go global.
